Date: 2021-05-02

## Status

Accepted

Amended by [3. Java EE as framework for microservices](0003-java-ee-as-framework-for-microservices.md)

## Context

We need to decide on a primary programming language for our backend microservices that fit into
the technology landscape of our enterprise.

## Decision

The primary language used to implement microservices is Java. It is a stable language, with good framework and tooling support for microservices. Also, there is widespread Java know-how in the  team and developer community.

## Consequences

Every developer on the team needs a development environment with a JDK11 and IntelliJ installed.
